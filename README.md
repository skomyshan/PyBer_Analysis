# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis:
###### As a new addition to PyBer, a ride-sharing app, I as a data analyst was tasked with analyzing all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019. Concluding my analysis with a visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize, using Matplotlib and objected-oriented analysis to present my findings. For the challenge portion, I was tasked with creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using my knowledge of Python and Pandas, in addition to creating a multiple-line graph that showcases the total week fares for each city type.
## Results
###### After reviewing the summary, there are several key findings:
###### • Urban cities saw the highest ridership, followed by suburban, with rural seeing the least.
###### • The amount of drivers mirrors ridership, with urban areas equipped with the most drivers, following by the suburbs, with rural areas seeing the least.
###### • The average fare per ride column indicates rural areas have the highest average fare per ride, followed by the suburbs, with urban areas seeing the lowest average fare per ride.
###### • The average fare per driver is highest in rural areas.
###### • The summary data indicates that fare revenue is highest in the city types with more drivers available, leading to smaller average fares, and overall higher ridership.
## Summary
###### Based on the results, I'd recommend V. Isualize do the following:
###### 1) Add more drivers to underserved areas to increase supply, lowering average fares while simultaneously increasing ridership. 
###### 2) Investigate what types of cities have lower car ownership rates as to designate more drivers to those particular areas.
###### 3) Investigate the demographic present in the types of cities serviced, i.e., are we servicing a college town with a young population that needs a way to get home on a friday night? Or, are we the city types we're servicing predominantly home to families with multiple cars parked in their driveway?
